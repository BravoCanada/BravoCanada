								<p><strong>1) What is the procedure to study in Canada?</strong></p>
								
								<p>The first step is to get admission to a ​Canadian Designated Learning Institution ​recognized by the government of Canada. Once an individual receives a letter of acceptance from an institution, he or she may be able to apply for a study permit. Applications may be made online or by mail. All new study permits are issued at a Canadian port of entry. An applicant who has submitted an application to a foreign Canadian Visa Office will be issued a letter of approval advising him or her to travel to a Canadian port of entry to have the study permit issued. A study permit is generally issued for the duration of the person’s studies.</p>
								
								<p><strong>2) ​Do I need to show proof of funds when applying for a study permit?</strong></p>
								<p>​Canada study permit applicants need to prove they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, and financial capacity to support living expenses for the first year of study. ​More information can be found at Canada Citizenship and Immigration website</p> 
								
								<p><strong>3) ​What is the difference between a Study Permit and a Temporary Resident Visa?</strong></p>
								<p>While a study permit authorizes international students to pursue their higher education studies in Canada, a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) allows a person to enter Canada to visit or persue short term language studies. Depending on the country of citizenship, an international student may need a TRV for entry. You can check your eligibility  ​here​. <p>
		 
								<p><strong> 4) ​What items should I have prepared when entering Canada?</strong></p> 
								<p>As a student you should have all your documents prepared:</p>
								<ul>
								   <li>You should have a valid passport, with a valid visa</li>
								   <li>You should have the letter of acceptance from the school you will be attending</li>
								   <li>You should have proof of your funds</li>  
								   <li>You should have your return ticket</li>
								   <li>You should have the address that you will be staying in</li>  
								   <li>You should have filled out the immigration form that is provided during your flight.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p><strong>5) ​My Visa got denied, can I get a refund?</strong></p> 
								<p>In cases of cancellation due to rejection of the visa, the refund policy will be differentiated, namely:</p>
